dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This code has been modified to incorporate a number of patches from https://st.suckless.org/patches/

dynamicscratchpads - https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dynamicscratchpads/
Allows for the management of scratchpad windows dynamically. You can hide, show (cycle through) and remove any window from scratchpad without specifying them in the config.h.

pertag - https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/
This patch keeps layout, mwfact, barpos and nmaster per tag.

cfacts - https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cfacts/
Increase and decrease a clients weight, thus increasing and decreasing the space client is allocated in its current stack.

cfacts-bottomstack - https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cfacts/dwm-cfacts_bottomstack-6.2.diff
bstack and bstackhoriz layouts compatible with cfacts/changing the clients weight.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
You can start this however you would like.
I've added the below to my .xinitrc

$ cat .xinitrc
# Just do the basics. Start up slstatus, set the mouse pointer, set the background and then start dwm.
/usr/local/bin/slstatus &
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr
xsetroot -solid black
/usr/local/bin/dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
